# Prediction-Model
In this project, I developed a prediction model to estimate the number of study hours based on given scores using Python and its powerful data analysis and machine learning libraries, including Pandas, NumPy, and Scikit-learn. The primary objective was to understand the relationship between students' scores and the hours they studied.
